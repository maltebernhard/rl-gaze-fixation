# gaze-fixation

## ToDo:
- make reward margin visible in render, include into config
- adapt robot state:
    - uncouple angle from pose, split into point and orientation
    - make velocity dependent on robot orientation
    - include velocity into observations
- make distance to target time-variant and include in observations / exclude from config

- long run: make robot be unable to see past obstacles
